# Array Reverse
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

Utilize the Single-responsibility principle: any methods you write should be clean, reusable, abstract component parts to the whole challenge. You will be given feedback and marked down if you attempt to define a large, complex algorithm in one function definition.

## Examples

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: [6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Input: [89, 2354, 3546, 23, 10, -923, 823, -12]
Output: [-12, 823, -923, 10, 23, 3546, 2354, 89]
