# Linked List
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Create a Linked List class. Within your Linked List class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

Include the following methods: `insert`, `includes`, `to string`

## Examples

`insert`

- Arguments: value
- Returns: nothing
- Adds a new node with that value to the `head` of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

`includes`

- Arguments: value
- Returns: Boolean
  - Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

`__str__`

- Arguments: none
- Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as: `"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"`
