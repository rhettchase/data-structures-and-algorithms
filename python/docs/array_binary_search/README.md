# Array Binary Search
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Examples

Input: `[4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42], 15`
Output: `2`

Input: `[-131, -82, 0, 27, 42, 68, 179], 42`
Output: `4`

Input: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7], 4`
Output: `-1`
